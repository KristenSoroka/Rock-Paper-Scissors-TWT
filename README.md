Rock, Paper, Scissors Project following along with Tech with Tim video 3/5

how i would go about breaking down the tasks
1. computer selects one of the options
2. player selects one
3. compare states and determine who is the winner or if it is a draw***.
4. keep track of the wins

***I added the draw conditional to my game that way the computer doesn't get a point for a matching conditional.  Not sure if it would but still thought it would be good to have.

Bonus challenge:
  set up the game to be best of 5 rounds
